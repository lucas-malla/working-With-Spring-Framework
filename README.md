# working-with-Spring-Framework
 #Structure of a Spring Project: We looked at the initial structure of a Spring project and discussed packages, classes and the run method.
 #Type Inference in Java: We saw a practical example of type inference with ‘var’ in Java code.
 #API Consumption: We learned how to consume APIs through the ‘getData’ method, which returns the desired data in Json format.
 #Code Modularisation: We learnt the importance of having modularised and maintainable code.
 #Serialisation and Deserialisation: We learnt how to transform JSON into classes and how this is useful for the project.
 #Creating Interfaces and Implementing Methods: We demonstrated the creation of an interface with a generic method using Generics, as well as the implementation of this method in a separate class.
 #Adding New Dependencies to the Project: We saw how to add a new dependency to the .pom.xml file and how this process is handled by Maven.
